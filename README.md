## 🛡️ Who is this for?

- **Anti-Fraud**: Instantly detect suspicious connections, anonymizers, proxies, and bypass tools.
- **AML**: Accelerate manual and automated KYC/AML checks by flagging risky IPs, VPNs, and proxies.
- **Cybersecurity**: Prevent attacks, phishing, click fraud, and other risks associated with anonymous or high-risk IP addresses.
